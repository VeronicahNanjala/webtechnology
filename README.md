# Project name: Ngoma Music

A website has been created to enable users understand the brand of Ngoma and interact with us at a minimal stage through login, sign up and contact form. Ngoma site serves to promote African music and provide a unique platform that will keep all users updated with the African Music Arts and potential events to capitalize on.

The main functionalities will be to upload music, find music sources, advertise concerts, events and opportunities for the African Music Industry.   

Landing Page - you have the opportunity to sign up or sign in. Upon that, you have access to the Home page to have a full Ngoma experience.

Home Page - you have content on Ngoma (about, team, activities). You can browse through to explore various events. No music uploads have been done yet. This project phase is only showcasing the Ngoma brand and events across Africa.

Sign Up - you have two options when signing up. If you describe yourself as a listener, you have a different sign up sheet as well as an Artist. This is the case because in the future, both entities will have different features when experiencing our platform

Contact Form - you have the opportunity to share any comments or concerns you have so we can address it.

Events - displays all upcoming concerts, festivals, launches that African musicians are holding or engaging in to keep users updated on what events they can possible patronize.
