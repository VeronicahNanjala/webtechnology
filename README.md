# Welcome to Ngoma Music Project

--> WebTech Group Project --<

Developing a website that promotes access to authentic African music. This project is evolved around providing a platform for African Music Talents to share their music as well create a hub where many Africans can access any African song of their choice regardless of the genre. 
With the team project, two meetings were held on concept development and team task allocations. 
Briefings were done on suitable templates to be used to suit brand of Ngoma Project.
As, you go through each branch, you will find the following:

    1. Ngoma UI ( Bootstrap Template)

    4. Mini Database ( to test and hold login details)
    5. Admin (Employees Page)
    6. Listener and Artiste page
